#CirruScope



CirruScope is a simple weather app. For now, I cannot list the features and details as it is yet to be created.



CirruScope came from 2 words, "Cirrus" and "Scope". Cirrus is a type of cloud, typically found in fair weather. Scope is used as a term for "looking out" or "viewing the surroundings." Combined together, they mean "looking out for fair weather."
